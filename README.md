## Introduction

This project presents a low-level design for a Stack Overflow application, outlining the fundamental entities, their relationships, and the RESTful API endpoints required for the application to function.

## Design Overview

The design includes the following main components:

- **User Management**: Represents users and their authentication.
- **Question and Answer**: Handles the creation and retrieval of questions and their corresponding answers.
- **Tags and Categories**: Deals with tagging questions and categorizing them.
- **Voting and Reputation**: Manages user votes and reputations for quality contributions.
- **Comments**: Enables users to leave comments on questions and answers.

## Features

The design includes:

- Posting, editing, and deleting questions.
- Answering questions.
- Voting for questions and answers.
- Tagging questions with relevant tags.
- Commenting on questions and answers.
- Categorizing questions into different categories.
- User reputation system.

## Endpoints

The project defines a set of RESTful API endpoints using Spring Boot:

- Endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting questions.
- Endpoints for answering questions.
- Endpoints for voting on questions and answers.
- Endpoints for tagging questions and categorizing them.
- Endpoints for commenting on questions and answers.

## Getting Started

This project is intended to demonstrate the low-level design of a Stack Overflow application using Spring Boot. As it focuses solely on design and endpoints, no implementation details are provided. To start using the design:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Review the design documents and the defined RESTful endpoints.
3. Implement the necessary business logic and functionality as per the design.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the design, documentation, or overall concept are welcome! Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
